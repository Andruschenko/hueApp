A [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) App to enhance your productivity.

1. Take a photo of a whiteboard with notes circled with different colors.
2. In the background the image is composed into parts corresponding to the circled bits and grouped by color.
3. The grouped images are then send back to this app and displayed.
